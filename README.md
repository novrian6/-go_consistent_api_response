# -go_consistent_api_response


This is repo of code from an article: https://novrian.substack.com/publish/post/165502113

In this article, weâ€™ll discuss a complete implementation of a standardized response format in a RESTful API built with Go and the Gin framework. We will cover:  A consistent response structure for both success and error responses  Built-in pagination metadata  API versioning for future-proof design

Why Consistency Matters

APIs that return inconsistent response formats can lead to confusion and additional logic on the client side. For example, some endpoints might return errors in different formats or missing useful metadata. By enforcing a standardized format, every response can be parsed the same way, regardless of success or failure, making the API is more predictable and easier to integrate.
